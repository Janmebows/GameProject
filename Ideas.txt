	-	Attack Skill ideas
		-	Blink/dash - tp from a to b (short range)
		-	Magic weapon throw
		-	Buff weapon
			-	Enhance speed
			-	Add Element
			-	
		-	'Stuck' weapon (this could all be a particular skill or something)
			- explodes (or something) in enemy (see below)
	-	Attacks Stick/bounce on larger enemies
		-	Based on weight/size/armour/toughness of skin(?), type of weapon, quality of swing
		-	
	-	Super duper targetting system that leaves Andrew aroused
		-	for multiplayer purposes allow to change targetting highlight colour either:
			- a setting that you can change
			- based on the equipment you're using
			- Maybe change colour for each party member and slight change of targeting reticle design for different class of weapon/equipment
	-	Appendage System
		-Execute on weakened enemies (after disabling arms/legs)

-	Rather then set 'classes' for characters could have weapon skills/masteries
	-	let players choose what weapon they use and dont lock them to it
	-	build mastery of a weapon through use and 'training' (<- training per say may be a bit iffy idk)
	-	if a player wants to switch weapon they can, however include a punishment for other stats not being used
	-	e.g. a player uses weapon A for a while, builds up a bit of skill, switches to weapon B, building different skills, causing other non-used skills to decay
	-	encourages use of weapons previously used rather than farm and max out and forget about it
	-	Could be annoying to some if coming back to Weapon A after using Weapon B for a long period of time
		-	^ Combat this with accelerated skill earning when revisiting previously used weapon
			-	^ remember the highest level that skill has had

-	Definitely gotta have a marriage system, gotta get dem waifus
	- Probably not

-	'everyday life' skills (maybe)
	-	IF WE DO THIS IT WILL BE AFTER LITERALLY EVERYTHING ELSE
	-	If we're planning on implementing normal skills (such as cooking, smithing, etc) include minigame of sort
	-	(Rather than just a number going up for clicking the 'cook' button)
	-	instead of minigame [MAYBE A BIT TOO AMBITIOUS] 
		-	For cooking for example, reward places with bonus skill XP for experimenting with new, unknown ingredients, creating new meals with added bonuses (or whatever purpose food serves ingame)
	

	


NOTES
To code the system Andrew wants
A class for body parts
each part has a reference to another part to the up, down, left, right (possibly generalise this to instead find the closest part based on input)
a bool for whether or not this one is targetted, some way to tell if player is behind (to swap left,right)


Light + Particles to identify where the player(s) is/are targetting
	- Particles should launch normal to the mesh somehow.
